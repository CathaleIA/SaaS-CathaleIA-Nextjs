# AWS Serverless SaaS Workshop
The goal of this workshop is to build a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution using AWS Serverless Services, such as Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS CodePipeline, and Amazon CloudWatch.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to understand the challenges that are unique to a SaaS based delivery, such as onboarding, tenant isolation, data partitioning, tenant deployment pipelines, observability, and how to address them using AWS Serverless services.
